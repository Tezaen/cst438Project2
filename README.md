### Iteration 1
**User Story:** Set up backend functionality by Roober:
> I started out with setting up the index.js file that uses Express API for the handling
> of routes. I also set up the back end code for creating a new account/registering and logging in.

**User Story:** Set up SQL file by Miguel:
> My first user story assigned was the SQL file which was an important user story to get done early.
> Mainly because it goes hand in hand with the backend and frontend of the project.

### Iteration 2
**User Story:** Edited SQL file and started on inventory page by Roober:
> I helped Miguel with the SQL file and implemented cart and cartItem tables. Unfortunately, we realized that
> we did not need those with the way that the shoppingcart page was set up. I also set up the inventory page
> with Carmelo and Mytzy and Miguel styled it.

**User Story:** Updates/changes on SQL by Miguel
> As stated by Roober, we had to make changes to the SQL file and add files we would need later. We added the
> cart and cartItem tables, but when we reached the ejs file for cart, we realized they were unnecessary.
> During this week I also helped Mytzy and Carmelo with frontend styling, HTML/CSS.

### Iteration 3
**User Story:** Worked on product details page by Roober:
> This iteration, I worked on populating the productDetails.ejs / "inventory/cheeseId" page with the right
> details of the product.

**User Story:** Frontend stuff by Miguel
> This week was slower, in that I just worked on fixing stuff that didn't look right on the frontend part of
> the project.

### Iteration 4
**User Story:** Set up the admin pages and fixed shopping cart by Roober:
> I set up admin originally to be able to add cheeses and things, but with the way shopping cart set up. We didn't have enough time
> to set up back end stuff to work with the shopping cart nor change the shopping cart at the last minute. Now admin can see the user info as well as
> info of cheeses.

**User Story:** Admin functionality, some backend and styling by Miguel
> I worked on admin with Roober so that we could be able to have a "store clerk" delete or update products on the products list.
> It soon became apparent that this was much more complicated than we intially thought. Although we couldn't make use of it,
> I implemented what would've been for the update and delete, along with backend code to go along with it.
> Finally, I contributed a bit more to the frontend styling so that each card would appear in its own square.

### Things we couldn't get done
We could not get admin to add cheeses or remove cheeses from table without breaking the shopping cart or making it too complicated at the end of the project duration.
