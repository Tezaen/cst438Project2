### Iteration 1
**User Story:** Set up backend functionality by Roober:
> I started out with setting up the index.js file that uses Express API for the handling
> of routes. I also set up the back end code for creating a new account/registering and logging in.

### Iteration 2
**User Story:** Edited SQL file and started on inventory page by Roober:
> I helped Miguel with the SQL file and implemented cart and cartItem tables. Unfortunately, we realized that
> we did not need those with the way that the shoppingcart page was set up. I also set up the inventory page
> with Carmelo and Mytzy and Miguel styled it.

### Iteration 3
**User Story:** Worked on product details page by Roober:
> This iteration, I worked on populating the productDetails.ejs / "inventory/cheeseId" page with the right
> details of the product.

### Iteration 4
**User Story:** Set up the admin pages and fixed shopping cart by Roober:
> I set up admin originally to be able to add cheeses and things, but with the way shopping cart set up. We didn't have enough time
> to set up back end stuff to work with the shopping cart nor change the shopping cart at the last minute. Now admin can see the user info as well as
> info of cheeses.
